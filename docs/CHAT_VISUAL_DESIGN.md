# Native chat visual system

The shared ChatPage and ChatWindow use native Reactor/WinUI controls. This
presentation follows the reading rhythm of the published 2026.9.4 web chat
(source `3a9d69db306cd7f081e06254cb89c4bcc14a7107`) without
replacing Windows chrome, native input, or gateway contracts.

## Geometry and typography

`ChatVisuals` owns the shared geometry. The reading surface is capped at 768
pixels. Transcript prose is inset 16 pixels from the aligned composer edge.
Outer gutters are 12 pixels below 640 pixels and 40 pixels above it. The native
annotated rail overlays only the unused right gutter, leaving transcript and
composer centered on the viewport, including while the rail is focused.
The avatar is omitted below 960 pixels; at wider sizes its balanced side slots
leave prose centered. Accessible sender and footer identity remain.

The writing surface uses a 20-pixel corner radius, 16-pixel editor inset, and a
112-pixel minimum height. Message and code surfaces use 12-pixel corners.
These are chat surface tokens, not replacements for standard control radii.
All layout spacing is on the 4-pixel grid.

Prose uses native body type at 14 pixels with 21-pixel line height. Headings
use 24/20/16 pixels for H1/H2/H3 and below. Top-level blocks use one uniform
16-pixel gap (the native 4-pixel-grid approximation of Web's 14 pixels), with
zero extra top/bottom block margins. List and quote interiors are unchanged.
Text/media stacks use that same gap. The transcript has a 16-pixel lead-in. Comparisons
normalize the released web header separately rather than adding fake app chrome.
Code remains literal and selectable, with native horizontal and vertical
scrolling rather than truncation. Its header exposes the supplied language and
the existing Copy action. The code body uses native Consolas at 13 pixels with
18-pixel line height, matching the web's line rhythm while compensating for
Consolas's smaller glyphs relative to the web's 12-pixel monospace face.
The language label uses the same family at 12 pixels. Max-height line stacking
allows larger or fallback glyphs to grow instead of clipping at text scales.
The frame keeps 12-pixel horizontal and 8-pixel vertical padding so the more
readable leading does not crowd compact conversations. Code text uses the
native secondary text brush for a calmer tone, with system window text in HC.

Additional shared glyph aliases live in `FluentIconCatalog`: `ChevronDown`
(E70D) and `Stop` (E71A).
Glyphs do not scale with text. Text containers keep native scaling enabled.
Chat uses dedicated `ChatSubmit` (Up, E74A) and `ChatAttach` (Add, E710)
aliases. Global Send and Quick Send metaphors are unchanged.

## Theme resources

`Themes/ChatResources.xaml` owns the following semantic aliases in Default
(Dark), Light, and HighContrast. No web colors or external fonts are imported.

| Resource | Native source |
|---|---|
| `ChatCanvasBrush` | Transparent; system window in HC |
| `ChatComposerBrush` | `CardBackgroundFillColorDefault` |
| `ChatCardBrush` | `CardBackgroundFillColorDefault` |
| `ChatStrokeBrush` | `ControlStrokeColorDefault` |
| `ChatTextBrush` | `TextFillColorPrimary` |
| `ChatSecondaryTextBrush` | `TextFillColorSecondary` |
| `ChatUserBrush` | Windows accent at low opacity; full system highlight in HC |
| `ChatPendingUserBrush` | Transparent in every theme, revealing the conversation background |
| `ChatUserTextBrush` | Primary text; system highlight text in HC |
| `ChatRichTextStyle` | Native rich-text Foreground binding to `ChatTextBrush` |
| `ChatCodeTextStyle` | Native code Foreground binding to `ChatSecondaryTextBrush` |
| `ChatCopySuccessBrush` | `SystemFillColorSuccess`; system window text in HC |
| `ChatPickerAccentBrush` | Light/dark system accent variants; system window text in HC |
| `ChatSandboxOnBrush` | Fixed blue: `#005FB8` in Light, `#60CDFF` in Dark; system window text in HC |

HC maps surfaces, strokes and text to system window/button/highlight colors.
An HC resource simulation is not evidence that Windows HC mode was enabled.

Window layering follows WinUI Gallery: the Hub title bar and expanded navigation
pane reveal Mica, while `NavigationViewContentBackground` supplies one content
layer (`LayerFillColorDefaultBrush` in Light/Dark, system window in HC).
The embedded chat canvas is transparent so it neither hides nor doubles that
layer. The standalone chat window also uses Mica and paints the same navigation
content resource once below its header, including disconnected/loading states.
The composer and code cards use the card fill above that content layer.

## Controls and states

Queued submissions leave the textbox and remain after the current turn as normal
right-aligned user bubbles. A transparent `ChatPendingUserBrush`, subtle `ChatStrokeBrush`
outline, and slightly faded `ChatSecondaryTextBrush` distinguish them from sent messages without
reducing whole-bubble opacity. **Pending**, Copy, and Cancel appear underneath only
while the message is hovered or contains keyboard focus. The footer reserves its
space so revealing it never moves the message. Hidden actions do not accept
pointer taps, but remain keyboard-focusable. Accessible item status stays
available even when the visual footer is hidden.
Text remains selectable and attachment chips remain visible.
Cancel stays available until dispatch; failures keep their error and removal
action visible without hovering. Provider promotion replaces the pending row with the normal sent message,
without adding queue-only rows to history. This applies to both ChatPage and
ChatWindow. See the [pending-message concept](design/reference/concepts/states/pending-chat-message.md).

Chat responses are not read aloud by default. Enabling the Text-to-speech
capability permits playback but does not enable automatic spoken replies.
Settings > Voice > "Read responses aloud" opts in to automatic playback;
manual "Read aloud" remains available independently when the capability is
enabled. Existing saved read-aloud preferences are preserved.

Welcome quick-start suggestions use borderless native buttons with a quiet gray
`ControlAltFillColorSecondaryBrush` backplate and the shared subtle toolbar
hover/pressed resources. Disabled and keyboard-focus states remain native.
Gateway dashboard management lives in a Connection settings card rather than
occupying a row above the chat surface. Settings' Chat rail action opens Workspace
without changing the selected Settings page or discarding the chat draft.

The footer has a leading Attach/session group, model/reasoning selectors, and
quiet secondary actions beside the primary Send/Stop action. Every control stays
in one bottom row: model text shrinks rather than moving the selectors above
the actions. At viewport widths of 560 pixels or less, effort uses a gauge and
chevron with a 44-pixel target, retaining the full textual automation name and
tooltip. Below 400 pixels the session trigger uses its existing Sessions icon,
so Attach, Node Sandbox, session, model, effort, voice and Send all remain reachable.
The [Node Sandbox icon](design/reference/concepts/states/node-sandbox.md) beside
the microphone in the right-hand action group is blue when the saved setting is
on and gray when off. It opens a compact native flyout with an On/Off header,
one short explanation, and a Sandbox settings action, not a toggle.
The flyout says "Commands on this Windows node run in a sandbox" when On and
"Commands on this Windows node run without a sandbox" when Off. Enabled
`system.run` requires containment and blocks if it is unavailable; it never
falls back to host execution. This does not describe Gateway tools. Settings changes
refresh both mounted native composers without replacing drafts or attachments.
The compact effort trigger has a transparent idle background and the same
4-pixel interaction corners as the other toolbar controls. Its gauge and
chevron are vertically centered within the 44-pixel target. The shared toolbar
resource overrides survive resizing between text and icon layouts without
replacing native hover, pressed, disabled or keyboard-focus behavior. Picker anchor
capture preserves existing target mount callbacks.
There is no composer overflow menu. Voice preferences remain available in
Settings > Voice, where "Read responses aloud" controls the same shared
speaker mute state. Native focus, hover and disabled states remain.

The compact effort gauge is an explicitly requested exception to the font-icon
convention: `ChatEffortGauge` renders the published web SVG geometry with native
WinUI paths and an ellipse, not a font approximation or WebView. It preserves the
24-unit viewbox, 20-pixel display size, 2-unit round strokes, dial opacity and
needle rotation from -120 to +120 degrees according to the advertised stop index.
Off and unanchored values use the minimum angle. An advertised inherited default
may inform the gauge without becoming a persisted override. The icon remains
decorative; the button keeps the textual accessible name and tooltip.
The source is pinned to 2026.9.4 and credited in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

The model picker uses the standard native flyout presenter and an `AutoSuggestBox`
above one grouped, single-selection `ListView`. Native list-item templates own
hover, pressed, selected, selected-hover, disabled and keyboard-focus visuals,
including the selection indicator. Model labels use normal body typography,
metadata uses captions, and provider group headers use secondary captions.
`NativeChatModelPicker` owns that native content through Reactor's generated
control-wrapper API; `ChatModelPicker` owns its flyout lifetime. Highlighting a
row does not change the model until activation. Search submission commits only
a single unambiguous selectable result; otherwise it moves focus into the list.
Unrelated composer rerenders preserve list navigation, and reopening restores
the configured selection. The list has a bounded native scroll viewport.

All footer pickers keep top-end placement. Effort retains its custom-content
native flyout with 12-pixel corners and explicit compact padding, applying
presenter styles through native setters on mount and update.
Effort uses a native discrete slider over the
advertised stops, a textual heading/current value, and Faster/Smarter captions.
A single advertised stop uses a labeled button. The explicit Default reset
remains separate from the slider; neither opening the flyout nor its initial
value writes a setting. A Fast-mode switch is not displayed because that
workflow is not implemented by this composer. No decorative nonfunctional
web-only controls are added.
Native virtualization, scroll navigation and list lifetime remain with the
existing timeline and scroll-controller owners. The visual refresh does not
replace their navigation algorithm.
Pending attachments use a bounded horizontal rail with 56-pixel chips, 32-pixel
removal targets and room for focus visuals instead of growing the composer for
every file. Video-specific previews are not invented by the native file rail.

The model flyout searches and groups only the existing catalog. Provider,
context and availability descriptions use `ChatModelLabels`. Provider headings
use the published web display names (for example, `github-copilot` becomes
`GitHub`), with a readable fallback for unknown IDs. Search accepts either the
display name or the original ID; grouping and wire identities keep the original ID.
The picker contains concrete catalog models only, with no Default/reset action.
An inherited model is shown by name when advertised, otherwise the trigger says
"Model". Opening or filtering the picker never changes the existing override.
The effort picker's separate Default reset and controller authorization paths
are unchanged.
No custom-ID, favorites, Fast, temperature or other gateway-backed setting is
invented.
Unknown nonempty thinking levels remain visible verbatim and do not check
Default. Reasoning choices come only from advertised session metadata, compatible
session defaults, or an exact provider/model catalog entry with no runtime conflict,
in that order. The first profile owns the choices, including explicit empty lists.
Structured IDs, labels and order are preserved; legacy `thinkingOptions` use
the gateway's public alias normalization. A `reasoning` boolean alone cannot
infer choices or veto an advertised mandatory profile.
Repeated profiles compare by their ordered options and default, not immutable-array
storage identity, so unchanged session/default/catalog metadata does not invalidate
the composer. Unknown and explicitly empty profiles remain distinct.

Without advertised choices the current value remains visible. A saved override
can still be cleared with Default; an already-default selector is read-only.
Default sends explicit JSON null, never an effective `thinkingDefault` value.
With no override, the slider and gauge show the advertised default's position,
while only the Default row is selected. Unknown explicit overrides are not
replaced by an inherited default.
Pointer previews commit only on release. Cancellation or capture loss while
pressed restores the current advertised selection without writing an override.
The native slider owns its value during the gesture, so unrelated snapshot
refreshes do not overwrite the active preview.
Deferred capture cleanup is gesture-fenced so it cannot cancel a newer input.
An authoritative session-list row that omits `thinkingLevel` clears the cached
override, while sparse activity events preserve it. Prepared profile metadata
may survive transient omissions only for the same identity and scope, and is
invalidated on a new connection. Model changes never replay the old override.
Model/reasoning changes require a connected, idle option-editing state;
the controller rechecks it for stale open-menu actions. Session browsing is not
disabled solely because the gateway is offline.
Context descriptions avoid repeating the group name.
The repository has a product brand mark but no
reusable provider-brand catalog, so providers retain accurate text rather than
invented logos.

The Web 9.4 retained-catalog warning/retry surface is deferred: the current chat
snapshot exposes model choices but no model-refresh failure state or explicit
refresh operation. Adding that surface requires a separate provider contract,
not view-owned network I/O.

Message and code Copy buttons use the same content/identity-fenced feedback
owner. A confirmed clipboard write shows a checkmark, announces Copied, and
resets after two seconds. Known clipboard access failures are logged and show
Copy failed instead. Repeated clicks restart the reset; content changes and
unmount cancel stale timers. Legacy `ClipboardHelper.CopyText` callers keep
their existing throwing behavior.
Code-copy automation IDs use `ChatCopy_code_<instance>` with a per-mount suffix,
so even identical snippets are independently addressable. The suffix survives
feedback and content rerenders, but is not a persistent conversation identifier.
Automation should discover the button in its code frame before retaining its ID.
Message-copy IDs remain based on the existing row identity.

Attachment, queue, recording, loading, thinking and error presentations use the
same resources and bounded layouts. Markdown sanitization, disabled HTML,
blocked link navigation, inert images, list measurement, timeline keys and
scroll-follow remain with their existing owners.
