# OpenClaw Windows node - architecture ledger

This document is the **living source of truth** for the architecture refactor
that decomposes the repository's god objects. It is required reading before you
touch any file listed in the ledger below.

Its job is to stop the refactor from silently regressing: when a PR moves a
responsibility out of a god object, it records the move here and (for
high-regression closures) adds a guard test. A later PR that tries to move the
work back then shows up as either a visible ledger edit or a failing test.

See `AGENTS.md` → "Architecture Guardrails" for the hard rules, and the full
multi-PR refactor plan for the reasoning behind each boundary.

## How to use this document

1. **Before editing** a file named in the ledger, read its row(s). Do not add
   back anything a row marks `closed`.
2. **When you extract** a responsibility, in the same PR:
   - Flip/add the ledger row for the new owner to `authoritative`.
   - Mark the vacated responsibility in the old owner as `closed`.
   - Update the "when you touch file X, extract toward Y" guidance below.
   - Add a guard test for the closure when a silent revert would be dangerous.
3. **Prefer behavioral/golden guards.** Use `source-shape` guards only for a
   concrete prohibited pattern (a banned helper signature, a forbidden direct
   constructor call), never for broad architectural wishes, and always with a
   `retirement_condition`.

## Ownership rules

- **View** (XAML + code-behind): layout, named-control wiring, lifecycle event
  forwarding, minimal WinUI-only adapters. No gateway JSON parsing, no polling
  loops, no settings mutation, no imperative row factories.
- **ViewModel / Presenter** (`OpenClaw.Tray.WinUI/ViewModels`, `.../Presentation`):
  observable state, commands, pure projection. WinUI-free where practical - no
  `Microsoft.UI.Xaml`, no `Application.Current`, no `Window`/`Frame`/`Brush`/`Color`,
  no concrete `SettingsManager`. Unit-tested.
- **Service**: IO, gateway calls, registry/settings persistence, timers, process
  execution, WebSocket/MCP hosting. No UI types. No background work started from
  constructors.
- **App** (`App.xaml.cs`): composition root and top-level lifecycle only.
- **Shared mutable domains**: one observable service/store owns each persisted
  domain. View models consume snapshots and field-scoped or compare-and-swap
  mutations; they never own backing files, concrete managers, file observers, or
  parallel mutable caches.

## Single-source owners

These are the canonical homes. Do not reintroduce private copies elsewhere.

The tray icon's primary activation opens or focuses Workspace chat for configured
profiles, including while disconnected. `TrayController` invokes its chat callback and
`App` composes that callback with the `WindowManager` chat route. Explicit
Connection menu actions retain their settings route; opening Workspace does
not bypass chat authorization or pairing requirements.

`StartupSetupState` owns first-run eligibility from saved gateway configuration
or local MCP mode, independently of current connectivity and node pairing.
`WindowManager` applies the same eligibility to Workspace activation, including
forwarded launches and tray clicks: an unconfigured profile opens or refocuses
setup instead of creating Workspace behind it. Explicit companion routes remain
available for advanced connection setup.

Workspace footer text follows the macOS-hosted Control UI at
[`bda22f8`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/bda22f818d967ffa3551b3a729d5bc43863844c7/ui/src/components/app-sidebar-render.ts):
the current user's name, then email, then localized Owner; the second line is
connection status. `WorkspaceIdentitySource` reads `users.self` profile fields
(`displayName`, first `emails` entry), never an agent identity or Windows account.
`sessions.changed` with reason `profile-identity` invalidates the profile through
`GatewayService`/`AppState`; ordinary session updates do not trigger profile RPCs.
The window owns the display source lifetime, and stale results cannot survive
disconnect, replacement, or close. This cache is not used for authorization.

## Native Gateway MSIX lifecycle and shared-wizard handoffs

Windows deploys the MSIX. The current Gateway package owns its isolated session
and Gateway service; Companion owns setup, connection and credential handoff;
upstream OpenClaw supplies onboarding over RPC. The known legacy proof package
instead uses Companion's same-user process supervisor. Package installation,
a listening port, and successful onboarding are not
interchangeable readiness signals. `App` remains the composition root; do not
move package resolution, process inspection or setup finalization back into it.

### Package installation and discovery

Isolated runtime inspection and lifecycle ownership are separate. Verification
is cached per record and is always checked against fresh listener snapshots;
probing another package cannot transfer stop ownership. Only starts issued by
Companion are stopped on detach, and failed authorization rolls back only a
start issued by that same call. Explicit wizard restart uses a separate runtime
operation and preserves a pre-existing service's leave-running policy.
Ownership inspection, including the fresh check before credential handoff, has
a five-second deadline. Package inspection failures, including WinRT deployment
errors and an explicit unknown service state, deny handoff as unavailable
inspection rather than claiming a conflicting listener. Authentication recovery
classifies these unavailable probes as network failures.

`NativeGatewayMsixInstaller.InstallAsync` invokes the signed-in user's App Installer
alias (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\winget.exe`) through the existing
`CommandRunner`, without a shell or elevation. The fixed command is
`install --id 9NV70LV3D6XC --source msstore --silent --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements --disable-interactivity --no-upgrade`.
The native review explains that selecting **Set up gateway** authorizes installation
and accepts the package and Store source agreements. Microsoft Store still owns
architecture/package selection, signature validation and deployment. There is no
automatic Store-page fallback: missing WinGet, policy/source failures and nonzero
exit codes produce explicit retry/repair guidance with sanitized, bounded output.
Command success is not package readiness. There is no local source path,
environment override, direct download, certificate-trust change, or ARM64-only gate.

`NativeGatewayPackageResolver.ResolveAsync` subsequently requires exactly one
matching current-user package registration, verifies package health, and resolves
its package-qualified `openclaw.exe` and `clawctl.exe` execution aliases. Never
substitute a generic PATH/npm command, copied executable or guessed WindowsApps
installation path. `NativeGatewayPackageClient` probes `clawctl status --json`
for `integration.kind: "isolated-session"` and version `1`. An unversioned
response that already describes a session is unsupported, not a legacy
fallback. Only the known `0.0.0.0` and `0.0.0.1` proof packages retain the
same-user path.
`NativeGatewaySetupHost` invokes `clawctl setup --json` and requires a ready
isolated session before configuring it; that command does not perform
Gateway onboarding.

`NativeGatewayPackageIdentity` accepts the Store manifest's exact pair:
`OpenClawFoundation.OpenClawGateway` and
`CN=4BA40A7A-B719-4C40-BF91-84AF4F1136FC`
([packaging manifest](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-windows-packaging/blob/96770f14d73edfcba41964c08cd2f64f39420278/src/OpenClaw.Launcher/Package.appxmanifest)).
The original `OpenClaw.Gateway` / OpenClaw Foundation development publisher pair
remains accepted for already installed packages and saved profiles. Names and
publishers cannot be mixed. New setup with both identities installed produces an
explicit duplicate-registration error, not an implicit migration or preferred-package
fallback. The runtime resolver selects the saved profile's exact family, so an
existing Gateway remains usable when both packages are installed. Runtime records
remain pinned to their saved package family; Store
installation does not rewrite a development profile's identity. Package-family
syntax checks admit both names, while registration and exact family matching
remain mandatory before launching. An existing same-user record is not silently
migrated to a newly installed isolated package; it requires new setup.

`scripts\NativeGatewaySourceBuild.psm1` owns the source-build safety boundary:
machine-wide build/unregister serialization, protected creation of work directories,
read-only validation of existing tree and ancestor ACLs, and prebuilt metadata/hash
validation before cache selection. Existing unsafe permissions are rejected, not
silently repaired. This protects loose-package code without changing Store resolution.

Developers opt in to a source-built Gateway with
`OPENCLAW_NATIVE_GATEWAY_DEV_PATCH=<patch>`. `scripts\Build-NativeGatewayFromSource.ps1`
builds an `openclaw/openclaw` ref and registers it with the packaging repo's
`Deploy-LocalPackage.ps1 -Patch` as the side-by-side loose registration
`OpenClawFoundation.OpenClawGateway-<patch>` under the Store publisher, with
package-qualified aliases `openclaw-<patch>.exe` and `clawctl-<patch>.exe`. While the
variable is set, new setup selects only that patched package
(`NativeGatewayPackageIdentity.IsSelectable`) and a missing patch is an explicit error,
never `NativeGatewayPackageNotInstalledException`, so WinGet never runs. Saved profiles
bound to a patched family resolve only while the variable names that patch
(`IsResolvable`); otherwise the resolver reports which value to set. With the variable
unset, selection, resolution and aliases are identical to the Store path.

After native capability/permission review, `NativeGatewaySetupPage` starts
automatically. It rechecks device support, then calls
`NativeGatewayPackageAcquisition.EnsureAsync`. Only the typed
`NativeGatewayPackageNotInstalledException` starts WinGet installation, once per attempt.
Healthy registration skips installation; duplicate registration, unhealthy packages
and missing aliases fail explicitly instead of triggering reinstall loops.
The cancellable acquisition deadline is five minutes including installation and
registration verification, with one-second polling after WinGet completes.
Cancellation reaches `CommandRunner`, which stops its WinGet process tree;
Windows may still finish an already submitted deployment. No installed package
is removed, and retry starts by resolving registration again.

The page uses the shared `OnboardingMascot`, native `SettingsCard` rows with
`SetupPhaseStatus`, and `SetupProgressIndicator` for support, package readiness,
profile preparation and verified runtime startup. Completed rows get checkmarks.
Its Install stage leads to the same focused AI and Ready stages as WSL, with six
native stages (WSL has an additional installation review). Progress sits above wrapping navigation actions on
both pages so narrow windows do not overlay buttons on the indicator.
It automatically transfers the staged session to `AiSetupPage`; no separate
Install, Check again or Open Gateway setup actions remain. Retry is error/cancel
recovery only. Preview never installs or starts a Gateway.

Native and WSL use the same `CapabilitiesPage` profiles and toggles. Native
installation consent stays on that page, without a separate review or
WSL/Local AI/Tailscale probes. Cancelling returns to capabilities without
automatically restarting a runtime.
On finalization, the session applies selected command IDs to the Gateway's
`gateway.nodes.commands.allow` through the upstream CLI before config/health
verification. The isolated path applies this inside the agent account, not
under Companion's Windows profile; legacy profiles retain the local writer.
Focused completion explicitly restarts through the selected runtime owner and
reverifies the exact model before publication. The isolated runtime preserves
whether a pre-existing service should be left running on detach. Focused setup
drains its operator before finalization and does not call isolated Stop before
Restart, which would otherwise discard stop ownership for a setup-started service.
The shared setup settings owner then saves the reviewed capability, transport
and startup choices without overwriting unrelated settings. Settings write
failure stays retryable before releasing the session. Completion shows the
verified model and three destinations, not a running or paired Windows node.
The normal connection owner still performs node connection/pairing; Windows
permission and exec-approval gates are unchanged.

Native package setup uses the shared `AiSetupPage` and `AiReadyPage` flow.
Only an explicit unsupported-method result offers `WizardPage` compatibility
setup. Authentication failures, timeouts and uncertain writes do not enter that
fallback. Healthy native and WSL AI/Ready screens use the same presentation:
providers, verified model and the three destination choices, without a native-only
summary. Gateway and permission details remain in Connection and Permissions.
Native recovery actions and output appear only for actionable errors or uncertain
outcomes on the AI page/provider dialog, and hide again during normal progress or
after recovery. Their native ownership and cancellation guards are unchanged.

### Capability recommendation and Windows Update

The 2026-09-18 onboarding decision removed the separate "not isolated"
warning/checkbox. General security consent and exact-identity pairing remain.
Capability eligibility alone does not establish the Gateway's runtime account:
the package-qualified versioned integration check selects the isolated
package path, while the known legacy proof remains same-user.

On Welcome, `NativeGatewaySetupEligibility` consumes the actual
`wxc-exec --probe` result `probes.isolationSessionAvailable` exposed by
`MxcAvailability.IsolationSessionCapability`. It must not infer session capability
from `IsolationProxy.exe`, a process-containment tier or a Windows build alone.
Windows Server/unknown SKU suppression remains in the shared probe. Missing or
invalid session metadata does not invalidate a usable process sandbox, but it
cannot authorize native onboarding.

A positive result enables and initially selects the first **Install a local native
gateway** card with the accent highlight and **Recommended** badge. A negative
capability result leaves that recommended choice visible but disabled after WSL and
**Connect to an existing gateway**, with Windows Update guidance directly below the
choice list; reopening the page rechecks support. The pinned SDK documents
Insider build **26340.9212** as its baseline. This is update guidance, not a
hardcoded admission floor or a promise that a particular feature is enabled.
The native boolean cannot distinguish every OS API failure from missing support.
Missing executables, malformed results and probe errors instead offer retry or
Companion repair, not an assertion that Windows must be updated.

The Welcome page presents WSL, **Connect to an existing gateway**, then disabled native
Gateway while support is being checked or unavailable. A positive result moves native
to the first position, followed by WSL and the existing-Gateway choice. WSL is visible
and selectable during the native probe and for every probe outcome, without an expander.
There is no Welcome-page **Check again** button.
WSL/Local AI discovery starts on page load; fresh WSL readiness and
destructive-replacement confirmation still run before its capabilities page.
WSL is never selected implicitly after a failed native probe. A late probe
result preserves explicit WSL and existing-gateway selections, including choices
restored on Back navigation. Re-entering the
page rechecks support, stale results cannot mutate an unloaded page, and native
package setup rechecks capability before preparing a profile.
`ms-settings:windowsupdate` only opens Settings; Companion does not enroll the
device in an Insider channel or change Windows feature flags.

### Draft and configuration ownership

`NativeGatewaySetupService` creates or resumes a credential-free draft descriptor
containing a Gateway ID, preferred loopback port, package family, and runtime
contract. The draft is not yet a published `GatewayRegistry` record. Companion
keeps its device identity under its own data directory, but an isolated package
keeps OpenClaw configuration, credentials and workspace under the agent account.

For an isolated package, `clawctl companion prepare --port <preferred> --json`
reads the agent's default `openclaw.json` and invokes upstream
`openclaw config patch` inside the recorded session. It preserves an existing
local port and token plus unrelated settings and rejects incompatible mode,
bind and authentication settings. Companion records the returned effective
port and token; it does not create a host-side `openclaw.json`, forward its
profile paths or install its own Gateway supervisor. Package
`gateway-service start/status/stop` owns the service lifetime. A cancelled
draft can resume without replacing the agent's credential. Finalization
checks that the returned port and token still match before publishing.

If an unpublished same-user draft survives an upgrade to an isolated package,
Companion shows an explicit replacement choice. Discarding removes only the
Companion draft descriptor, then starts isolated setup with a new identity.
Existing configuration, credentials and workspace files remain untouched, even
if a previously published connection was removed from the registry. Like
`StoreMigrationRecoveryDiscard`, native recovery discards intent, not user data;
the Inno-specific receipts and installation checks are not shared with native setup.
It never reuses host configuration as agent configuration. A published
same-user profile remains blocked and directs the user through Connections to
remove it and create a new isolated profile. It never adopts a foreign listener
or session, and it does not modify WSL or other package paths.

The following same-user profile and port-rotation path applies only to the
recognized legacy proof package. It creates a separate profile at
`<Companion data>\gateways\<gateway-id>\native-gateway`, with its own
`openclaw.json`, generated authentication token and workspace.

Retry re-reads the draft instead of keeping a stale in-memory port. If an
unpublished draft's port is occupied, `NativeGatewaySetupService` selects another
loopback port and updates only the port in the descriptor and configuration.
Gateway ID, identity, authentication token and provider settings are preserved.
A durable `PreviousPort` intent in the descriptor allows either interrupted
write to finish on the next attempt. Published records are never rotated by
this recovery. Runtime ownership checks still reject listeners that race startup;
no conflicting process is adopted or terminated.

For that legacy path, `NativeGatewayPaths` supplies explicit `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` and
`OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` for package commands, rather than using the user's default
Gateway profile. Launch paths are mapped through `ResolveDataPath` to physical
locations because Companion and Gateway can have different MSIX filesystem
views; canonical registry paths are unchanged. External-supervisor/service-repair
flags and disabled automatic updates preserve Companion's lifecycle ownership.

`NativeGatewaySetupSession` owns cancellation, pairing and final publication
gates for both paths. Only legacy setup backs up and suspends the reload setting
in its host-owned profile; the isolated path leaves the agent's existing
reload setting intact. Stopping either runtime does not delete its configuration.

### Isolated listener proof and legacy process ownership

After a successful package start acknowledgement, `IsolatedGatewayRuntime`
allows up to three minutes, including the start command, for its own start to
become ready. A late successful acknowledgement retains ten seconds for status
confirmation, extending the start/status ceiling to at most 190 seconds. This
allowance remains subordinate to caller deadlines; the outer 210-second connection
budget also includes preflight, inspection and handshake work. It polls status
every two seconds without issuing another start.
`starting` or `unhealthy` with no listener is only a pending observation, never
credential authority. A listener racing the pending observation permits one fresh
status recheck, but only `running` plus full port/process attribution can pass.
Unknown/terminal states, persistently unattributed listeners and failed
ownership checks fail closed. Cancellation/deadline failure retains the existing
owned-start rollback rules; pre-existing pending services are not adopted.
See [native startup contract limitations](ONBOARDING_WIZARD.md#native-startup-and-completion-deadlines)
for the older package's ambiguous failed-start response, which is not admitted.
The pending-start fixtures are conditional client-contract tests, not proof that
the installed package can acknowledge a pending launch.

`IsolatedGatewayRuntime` accepts a running Gateway only after a fresh
package-qualified `clawctl gateway-service status --json` attributes its
listener process IDs, creation times, and OS sequence numbers to the
recorded isolated session and agent SID. Companion compares that
attribution to two complete IPv4/IPv6 loopback snapshots and
`SystemBasicProcessInformation` process-sequence snapshots. It does not
open the isolated agent's process handle: Windows denies that cross-account
query. Windows 11 build 26100.4770 or newer is required for that
process-sequence API; unsupported builds fail closed with update guidance.
A port alone, a stale process ID, an unrelated listener, or a
replaced listener is denied. Its
synchronous browser credential callback uses the last attributed identity
plus fresh OS snapshots; it never starts a Gateway on the UI thread.

The process-job and ancestry checks below describe only the legacy same-user
runtime. They are not an MXC session ownership proof.

The installed package's launcher owns a separate kill-on-close job for Node.
Observed ownership with the development package was:

```text
Companion-owned Windows lifecycle job
  Packaged Gateway launcher
    Package-owned Windows lifecycle job
      Node process hosting the Gateway TCP listener
```

The original requirement that the TCP listener itself belong to Companion's job
rejected this valid arrangement: the launcher was in Companion's job, but Node
was not. A longer timeout, direct executable launch or an open loopback port
could not establish ownership. The exact Windows job-inheritance mechanism behind
that separation was not established.

`WindowsNativeGatewayProcessHost` now creates the package launcher suspended,
assigns it to Companion's kill-on-close job, retains its process handle, then
resumes it. Assignment/resume failures terminate the created process. Atomic
job-list creation had failed while the package was already active; suspended
creation and assignment worked with the existing Gateway still running.

`NativeGatewayRuntime` accepts the listener through direct job membership or
`WindowsPackagedProcessAncestry`: a live same-user descendant chain anchored to
that exact, still-job-owned launcher with the expected package family. Retained
process handles, parent/child creation ordering and bounded ancestry checks
prevent cached PIDs or executable names from being treated as ownership proof.
The runtime also requires complete IPv4/IPv6 inspection, loopback-only listeners,
the requested address, matching process creation times and two consistent TCP
snapshots. Unknown or replaced listeners are rejected, not adopted.

No new cross-package process-handle protocol was added to the packaging repo.
An explicit authenticated handle-handoff contract was considered; the implemented
solution uses local retained-handle attribution with the existing package.
Companion owns the launcher lifetime, while the launcher owns Node cleanup.
`NativeGatewayEndpointSecurity` and setup authorization use this verification
before credential-bearing connections, including reconnects.

`InteractiveGatewayEndpointAuthorizer` routes dashboard and web-chat HTTP
credential handoffs to the same runtime's fresh, double-snapshot inspection.
Its synchronous UI callback never starts a Gateway or waits for a busy lifecycle
gate; busy, stopped, disposed or replaced workloads fail closed. It does not
trust cached proof or connected status. App only composes this non-owning adapter;
process inspection stays in `NativeGatewayRuntime`. Non-native handoffs retain
`ManagedLocalGatewayPortProvenanceService` authorization. Typed native listener
conflicts retain `LocalPortConflict` classification instead of becoming generic
network failures.

The legacy path is same-user supervision, not an MXC sandbox or a security boundary against
malicious same-user code. There is a narrow crash window between suspended
creation and job assignment that can leave a suspended launcher; kill-on-close
cleanup applies after assignment, and no launcher code has resumed before then.

### RPC handoff to the existing wizard

This section describes the explicit compatibility path only. The normal native
path uses the same detected providers, activation, exact-model verification and
Chat/Channels/Skills chooser as WSL. `NativeGatewaySetupConnection` owns the
temporary operator socket in both paths; it never owns or replaces the native
runtime. `SetupWindow` retains `NativeGatewaySetupSession` across AI/Ready navigation.

The compatibility page retains the native wrapper with its exact client binding.
All wizard RPCs, including progress, cancellation and the optional-policy
config/health checks, pass through the generation-fenced request helper and native
per-request authorization. Replaced bindings cannot send through a newer client.
Page teardown cancels/drains requests and disposes the captured socket wrapper;
only the window releases the native session/runtime after page cleanup.

`NativeGatewaySetupPage` prepares the session and passes it to the shared
`WizardPage`. The page owns RPC/rendering; the session owns the profile/runtime.
There is no second provider UI or normal terminal-based onboarding path.

1. Validate initial configuration, start the package-owned service or legacy
   runtime as appropriate, and verify its listener before sending credentials.
2. Connect using the per-Gateway identity and prefer its stored device token.
   When pairing is required, `ApproveWizardPairingAsync` matches the handshake
   request ID against that identity's device ID and public key, rechecks endpoint
   ownership/configuration, and approves only the exact request via the package
   CLI. Never approve the latest unrelated request or bypass onboarding consent.
   The package omits listener ownership details if Windows cannot supply
   process-sequence evidence. Gateway health remains independent, but Companion
   refuses credential handoff until running on Windows 11 build 26100.4770 or
   later. Re-running `clawctl setup` cannot add this OS capability.
3. For the legacy profile, clear inherited URL overrides, pin the port and
   supply the token in the child environment, not argv. The isolated path
   uses package-qualified `openclaw devices list` and
   `openclaw devices approve <request-id>`. These commands run in the agent
   context and use its Gateway config; Companion checks that its saved port
   and token still match the agent config before each command. It does not pass
   the token or host profile paths to the CLI. The CLI budget includes slow
   package startup. Dispose the failed-handshake client
   before one bounded retry; disconnect alone does not stop its reconnect loop.
4. Call `wizard.start` with `mode=local` and `installDaemon=false`; render upstream
   steps and submit answers through `wizard.next`. `wizard.cancel` ends the
   session. Companion does not install a competing Gateway service.

`WizardOnboardingPolicy` supplies the same audited optional skip/keep answers to
native, WSL and headless onboarding. Consent, provider/auth/model choices,
permissions, unknown prompts and errors are not silently answered.
For isolated setup, `WizardConsoleTail` uses the authenticated operator's
upstream `logs.tail` RPC to project only root-logger `console.log` entries
after listener verification. The initial cursor is captured before
`wizard.start`, and later polls are byte/line bounded and already redacted
by OpenClaw. A gap or failure surfaces recovery-terminal guidance rather
than silently discarding an OAuth prompt. No package log-file path or host
profile is passed to the agent; legacy profile and WSL tail modes remain
separate.

### Finalization and transfer to normal connection management

The focused path admits only `GatewayAiSetupCompletion` bound to the same
Gateway endpoint/package family, persisted signing identity, agent, canonical
session and verified primary model. Showing the chooser publishes nothing.
Each destination freshly verifies through the staged native owner, then
`CompleteVerifiedAsync` stops the setup runtime, restores reload, applies selected
capabilities, validates configuration and health, and performs another exact-model
verification on the restarted runtime before publishing the record. It does not
set the classic wizard-completed flag. Publication reloads unrelated Gateway edits
and uses an expected registry snapshot; an already occupied draft ID is rejected.

After Companion restarts, verification borrows the normal connection manager's
native-authorized operator connection. It rechecks provenance on every request
and never starts a parallel native runtime or disposes that borrowed connection.
The generic `SetupGatewaySession` rejects native records. Windows-node WSL
workspace finalization never runs for this route.

At the Optional apps checkpoint, `WizardOptionalSetupHandoff` explicitly cancels
the remaining optional wizard tail, requires cancellation acknowledgement, and
checks `config.get` validity and authenticated `health`. The native session records
optional setup as deferred, not upstream wizard completion. Arbitrary errors or
user cancellation cannot take this success path.

After real wizard completion or the validated optional handoff,
`NativeGatewaySetupSession.CompleteAsync` performs:

```text
Stop setup-owned Gateway -> apply capability policy (and restore legacy reload)
-> validate endpoint/auth and config -> restart with verified ownership
-> authenticated health -> stop setup-owned runtime
-> save and activate GatewayRegistry record -> release setup ownership
```

Only then does the existing setup-completion restart path hand normal operation
to `GatewayConnectionManager` and its App-composed
`NativeGatewayRuntimeRouter`. The isolated branch delegates lifecycle to
`clawctl gateway-service`; it leaves a pre-existing package service running
when Companion detaches. The legacy branch retains Companion-owned process
supervision. Reconnect verifies package/agent listener identity again rather
than adopting an unrelated port. Failed/cancelled setup
must not publish an unverified Gateway record.

### Removal and remaining boundaries

Disconnect stops a Gateway that Companion started, but preserves its data;
an already-running package-owned service is not stopped merely because
Companion detached. Removing the saved Gateway in Connection settings removes
the registry entry, not the agent's OpenClaw configuration or a legacy
Companion-owned profile. Windows Installed apps owns MSIX uninstallation and
package-managed agent data; Companion's device identity is separate. Back up
configuration, credentials, workspace and conversation state before destructive
cleanup. The broader Companion/WSL uninstall flow is not a native-Gateway-only
uninstaller.

Gateway health alone does not prove AI-provider authentication, required
model-runtime availability or a usable default chat. The focused native path
requires live exact-model verification as well; the compatibility wizard retains
its narrower configuration/health summary. Real-package/provider E2E proof and
MXC isolation remain separate gates. See
[Gateway setup responsibilities](GATEWAY_SETUP_RESPONSIBILITIES.md) for the
investigation, production-backed proof and local-only recovery workarounds, and
[onboarding wizard](ONBOARDING_WIZARD.md) for the user flow. Regression coverage
lives in `NativeGatewayRuntimeTests`, `NativeGatewayWindowsProcessHostTests`,
`NativeGatewaySetupTests`, `WizardOptionalSetupHandoffTests` and
`NativeGatewaySetupUxContractTests`.

## Ledger

The ledger is machine-readable and validated by
`OpenClaw.Shared.Tests/Architecture/ArchitectureLedgerConsistencyTests.cs`.
Rows live between the BEGIN/END markers, one per line, pipe-delimited, with a
leading and trailing pipe. Columns, in order:

`id | status | old_owner | closed_responsibility | new_owner | allowed_residue | invariant | guard_test | guard_type | retirement_condition`

- `status`: `planned` | `authoritative` | `closed`
- `guard_type`: `behavioral` | `golden` | `source-shape` | `review-only`
- For `authoritative`/`closed` rows, `guard_test` must name a test as `Type.Method`
  (validated for format), OR `guard_type` must be `review-only` with a real
  rationale in `guard_test` (placeholders like `-`/`none` are rejected).
- For `behavioral`/`golden` rows, the named `guard_test` must actually exist in
  the `tests/` source tree - the consistency test scans for it, so renaming or
  deleting a guard without updating the ledger fails CI.
- `source-shape` rows must set a concrete `retirement_condition`.
- No literal `|` characters inside a cell (they break the pipe-delimited parse).
- Use `-` for a genuinely empty cell (except where a value is required above).

## Deferred test builders

`DeviceIdentityBuilder` and `SetupContextBuilder` are intentionally **not** in
`OpenClaw.TestSupport` yet. `DeviceIdentity` is a stateful Ed25519 key/file
service (not a value type) and `SetupContext` needs setup logger/journal/command-runner
fakes. Both will be added alongside their subsystem PRs (gateway protocol and
SetupEngine, respectively) so `OpenClaw.TestSupport` does not take a heavy
dependency on `OpenClaw.SetupEngine` prematurely.
